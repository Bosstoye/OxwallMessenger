{"name":"OxwallMessenger (POC)","tagline":"A native iOS app to power your Oxwall Social Networking site.","body":"# Oxwall Messenger\r\n\r\n**See this as a proof of concept.** Oxwall Messenger is in very early stage of development. At this point it is more of a demo app to show how to **connect to Oxwall DB using a set of webservices**. Nothing fancy so far. \r\n\r\nHopefully some day this will turn into a product that admins of Oxwall Social Networking sites can use to enhance their users experience.  \r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress, but if you want to check it out you are welcome to do so. Feel free to contact me with any questions at thomas [at] nocebo.se If you'd like to contribute to this project I'll be very happy! \r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n![Login screen](http://cloudshare.se/webservice/OM-1.png)![User profile](http://cloudshare.se/webservice/OM-2.png)![Message view](http://cloudshare.se/webservice/OM-3.png)\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nIf you think this project is interesting and you want to contribute to the development just fork the repo and start coding! This is how open source projects begin, grow, thrive and reach new users. **Let's make this happen!**\r\n\r\n## Open Source\r\n**This is Open Source - Okay, but what does it mean?**\r\n\r\n* You have the right to **Share** — to copy, distribute and transmit the work\r\n* You have the right to **Remix — to adapt the work**\r\n* You have the right to **make commercial use** of the work\r\n\r\nThat means it is you are welcome to download and modify the code if you want. You may also use the code in commercial products and solutions without violating the license agreement - but I prefer that you, if you choose to distribute the code, do it without charging for it. We all have to live, eat and feel good, but it is better to charge for services and customizations than outright sell the source code that you only partially been creating. It feels more morally correct. But it is still up to you.\r\n\r\n> **Doesn’t \"open source\" just mean something is free of charge?**\r\n\r\n> No. This is a common misconception about what \"open source\" implies. Programmers can charge money for the open source software they create or to which they contribute. But because most open source licenses require them to release their source code when they sell software to others, many open source software programmers find it more lucrative to charge users for software services and support rather than for the software itself. This way, their software remains free of charge and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it.\r\n\r\n>**[opensource.com](http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)**\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\nThis project uses (among others):\r\n\r\n* JSONModel: [https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel](https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel)\r\n* MessagesTableViewController: [https://github.com/jessesquires/MessagesTableViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/MessagesTableViewController) \r\n* ODRefreshControl: [https://github.com/Sephiroth87/ODRefreshControl](https://github.com/Sephiroth87/ODRefreshControl)\r\n* NewRelics Application Performance Management & Monitoring","google":"UA-44171196-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
